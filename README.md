For this project it was an individual project requiring the use of Java to synthesize a book store
terminal that allows a user to "order" books and build an order using an inventory of books. The inventory
used a dummy backend using a .txt file which was read from to confirm if the books exist, and if the user ordered
a book that exists, that book would than be added to the order. This project utilized a range of Java frameworks such
as the Swing GUI, file processing and some others. When the user finished their order, their order would not only display
on a Swing GUI popout, but also a .txt file would be created totaling their order with the quantity of items, the pricing
and unique IDs' per item which were generated.
<ul>
  <li>Programmed exclusively using Java</li>
  <li>Multiple different Swing GUIs were implemented</li>
  <li>Basic example of handlers and their implementations</li>
  <li>Simplistic exmaple of a Frontend interfacing with a Backend</li>
</ul>
